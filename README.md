# Insurance Policy Management System

This repository contains a Python project for an insurance policy management system. It includes three main class files and a `main.py` script for testing and running the system.

## Contents

1. `policy_holder_class.py`: This file contains the `Policyholder` class, which represents policyholders and manages their registration, suspension, reactivation, and display of active customers.

2. `payment_processing_class.py`: This file contains the `PaymentAndAccount` class, responsible for payment processing, account balances, and reminders for policyholders.

3. `product_management_class.py`: This file contains the `ProductManagement` class, which manages the subscription and unsubscription of products for policyholders.

4. `main.py`: This script is used to test the functionality of the insurance policy management system. It creates instances of the classes mentioned above and demonstrates their usage.

## Usage

To use the insurance policy management system:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the extracted files.
4. Run the `main.py` script using the command `python main.py`.
5. Follow the prompts and instructions provided in the script to interact with the system.
